# Dimensional Data Modeling in BigQuery

This repository contains an example project that demonstrates how to create a dimensional data model with a star schema in BigQuery using the Python API. 

## What is dimensional data modeling?

Dimensional data modeling is a design technique used to organize data into a structure that is optimized for querying and reporting. It involves organizing data into "facts" (numerical data that can be aggregated) and "dimensions" (descriptive data that can be used to slice and filter the facts), and creating relationships between them. It is a common approach to data modeling in data warehouses.

## What is a Data Warehousing?

Data warehousing is a process that involves collecting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a format that is optimized for analysis, and loading it into a data warehouse. Data warehouses are optimized for querying and reporting, and are often used to create dashboards and reports.

## Pre-requisites
To work with the code in this repository, you will need a Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled, access to the Google Analytics sample dataset in BigQuery, and Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine.

- install BigQuery: `pip install google-cloud-bigquery`
- Create a service account and download the JSON key file from the Google Cloud Console. You can follow the instructions in the [BigQuery documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) to do this.
